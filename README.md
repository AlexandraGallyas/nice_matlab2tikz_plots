# nice_matlab2tikz_plots
matlab script with my favorite options to create nice latex plots using matlab2tikz

Instructions:
- You need to have matlab2tikz. If you don't have it, download it.
- Open niceplot.m matlab script and run it. This script will create the tex file niceplot.tex.
- Open niceplot.tex and run it. This will generate a pdf niceplot.pdf with a nice plot.

Adapting the matlab script for your needs:
- Every time you edit the matlab script, you need to run the matlab script and then run the tex file again.
